====

A BitMessage headless client and library.

[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/nictuku/bitz/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/nictuku/bitz/latest)

The initial focus is to implement the BitMessage protocol and provide a library that others can use.

Speculative project goals:
*  No UI, but maybe a simple web API. Enable the development of a client-side Javascript/HTML5 solution.
*  Simple installation. Download an executable and you're done.
*  Multi-platform. Support for OSX, Linux and Windows.

This is a personal project not endorsed by my employer.
